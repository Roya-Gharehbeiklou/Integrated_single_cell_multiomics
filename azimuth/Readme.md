## Cell type annotation using Azimuth

In order to annotate cells that were preprocessed in Seurat from scRNA-seq, Azimuth (v.0.4.5, https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/) was used.
To use the annotated file in FigR one alteration was done: the cell types generated from Azimuth were manually relabeled to lower resolution (from 25 types to 6).
